    </figure>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a gentleman posted a comment on an article I wrote about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2015/08/11/does-the-aether-exist-hint-no/&#34;&gt;luminiferous aether&lt;/a&gt;. For those who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar, the aether was an idea proposed in the 1800s to explain how light can travel through empty space. Several experiments trying to observe the aether were performed in the late 1800s, but weren&amp;rsquo;t successful. This led Einstein to propose the theory of special relativity. Thus, the aether doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this gentleman doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in relativity. He thinks the Earth is stationary and at the center of creation. He proceeded to tell me so, and cited a paper from Nature&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that he claimed proved Einstein is wrong, and the aether exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature is a fairly impressive journal, so a controversial article on relativity is worth checking out. The gentleman didn&amp;rsquo;t give a proper citation, just &amp;ldquo;Nature Magazine August volume 322,&amp;rdquo; but it was a start. A quick internet search found dozens of websites citing the same article, all arguing the Earth doesn&amp;rsquo;t move, and all citing this article as evidence. A bit more searching and I found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/322590b0.pdf&#34;&gt;copy of the article&lt;/a&gt;. Well, kind of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out it isn&amp;rsquo;t an article. It&amp;rsquo;s a one column letter to the editor by one E. W. Silvertooth claiming he did an experiment with details to follow. No evidence, no link, no peer review, just an unsubstantiated claim. Still, supporters of a fixed Earth model cite this article a great deal, refering to it as the Silvertooth experiment. What they don&amp;rsquo;t tend to do is cite any actual experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A bit more searching led me to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.418.8179&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&#34;&gt;actual article&lt;/a&gt; describing the experiment.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Published in &lt;em&gt;Speculations in Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;, it outlines a way to measure the relative motion of the Earth through the aether. Silvertooth argues that if the speed of light changes, the wavelength of light must also change, analogous to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2013/09/05/doppler-effect/&#34;&gt;Doppler effect&lt;/a&gt;. He then describes how he compared wavelengths in the direction of Earth&amp;rsquo;s motion with wavelengths perpendicular to Earth&amp;rsquo;s motion. Since relativity assumes the speed of light is a constant, there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any difference. But Silvertooth seems to find a difference, and measures the Earth&amp;rsquo;s speed to be 378 km/s in the direction of the constellation Leo. Interestingly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2013/10/13/relative-motion/&#34;&gt;observations of the cosmic microwave background&lt;/a&gt; shows that Earth is moving through the universe in that direction at 371 km/s. How very fascinating! This experiment shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work, and yet it seems to overturn special relativity. Could Einstein have been wrong after all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silvertooth experiment is part of a range of experiments related to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2015/02/14/burden-proof/&#34;&gt;one-way speed of light&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that early experiments on relativity, such as the famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2013/10/14/aether-or/&#34;&gt;Michelson-Morley experiment&lt;/a&gt;, only measured the total travel time of light not the travel time in a single direction. What if the speed of light is slower in one direction, but faster in the opposite direction? What if the aether flowed past us like a river. The speed of light would be faster when moving downstream and slower coming back upstream, but the total travel time would be the same as if there were no aether at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of how early relativity experiments proved the aether doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist isn&amp;rsquo;t really true. What they showed was that the aether isn&amp;rsquo;t needed to explain the results. By the 1970s it was demonstrated&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that if an aether exists it must be completely undetectable by relativity experiments. The results would still agree with Einstein. So over the decades interest in the aether mostly waned. Why assume there is an aether when relativity does just fine without it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then how to explain Silvertooth&amp;rsquo;s results? It could be that he just got bad results, but the experiment was done several times and seemed to be consistent. And Silvertooth was no slacker. He was a physicist who joined Paramount Studios as an engineer during the great depression, won an Oscar for Technical Merit in 1942, and then went on to work for an Air Force think tank. But Silvertooth was also rather terse about the results, and since hundreds of experiments agree with relativity his results were probably wrong. The experiment faded into history, remembered mainly by the kind of people who think Aristotle was right about astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is usually where the story ends. Obscure experiments like this don&amp;rsquo;t often get repeated, and when they do they&amp;rsquo;re usually done by people who aren&amp;rsquo;t trained experimentalists. But in 2012 Doug Marett actually repeated the experiment&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.conspiracyoflight.com/Silvertooth/Silvertooth.html&#34;&gt;what he found&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 18 months Marett recreated the Silvertooth experiment, and confirmed the result. There was an apparent shift in wavelength that varied with the orientation of Earth, and it did seem to show an apparent motion of Earth in agreement with Silvertooth&amp;rsquo;s intial findings. But looking at the data more carefully, Marett also found that there was a lot of fluctuation in the data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Silvertooth&amp;rsquo;s original claim was that the wavelengths varied over the course of a sidereal day. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2013/11/27/a-suns-day/&#34;&gt;sidereal day&lt;/a&gt; is measured relative to the motion of the stars. Our normal solar day is based upon the motion of the Sun. Because of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s motion around the Sun, a solar day is about 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day. If Silvertooth was right, the wavelength variations should follow sidereal time, not solar time. Marett found there was so much noise in the data, the variation in wavelengths could be made to agree with either sidereal or solar time. Digging into things more closely, he saw a correlation between the observed wavelength shift and small fluctuations in the temperature of the room. The change in temperature was shifting the alignment of the experiment laser, causing the apparent shift Silvertooth saw. Marett also found that the calculated motion of the Earth only worked because Silvertooth assumed the data measured an actual wavelength shift. Silvertooth&amp;rsquo;s results were real, but his conclusions were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the aether doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, but for now it is clear we don&amp;rsquo;t need an aether to explain Silvertooth&amp;rsquo;s experiment. In a broader sense, this story is an excellent example of the striking difference between science and pseudoscience. In pseduoscience folks are content to cite an article without any consideration of the actual results. If it seems to agree with your expectations, then that&amp;rsquo;s good enough. As a scientist, Marett took the time to look at an old experiment with a questioning eye. In doing so he solved a 30-year old mystery of the experiment that seemed to prove Einstein wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    </figure>&lt;p&gt;Each of us has a beginning and an ending. We awake to explore the universe for a brief time, then return to our cosmic slumber. Stephen Hawking was no different. He was born in January of 1942, and he died on 14 March 2018. He was fascinated with beginnings and endings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his doctoral dissertation, Hawking focused on the nature of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/03/24/primeval-atom/&#34;&gt;big bang&lt;/a&gt;, specifically whether it began as a singularity. A singularity is where the very nature of space and time break down. The curvature of space at a singularity becomes infinite, and matter at a singularity has infinite density. They first appeared in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2015/01/22/pointed-debate/&#34;&gt;context of black holes&lt;/a&gt; (still hypothetical at the time) where it was thought that the matter of a large dead star would collapse forever under its own weight. Hawking showed that general relativity required the big bang to be a singularity, hence the idea that the universe began as a single point of infinite energy density. Years later Hawking and others demonstrated that a big bang singularity wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary. Because of quantum mechanics, a singularity might not even be possible. Whether the universe began as a singularity or merely as a hot dense state is still an issue of much debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work Hawking is most known for concerned black holes. In general relativity, black holes have an &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/02/03/edge/&#34;&gt;event horizon&lt;/a&gt;. That is, a boundary surrounding a black hole that is a cosmic point of no return. Cross the event horizon, and you are forever trapped. But this caused several problems in theoretical physics. For example, if an event horizon were truly a point of no return, and not even light can escape, then black holes would be absolutely cold. According to thermodynamics, every object gives off some light as thermal heat. General relativity said that black holes have a temperature of absolute zero, which thermodynamics says is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawking found that this contradiction could be solved through quantum mechanics. General relativity is a classical theory, meaning that objects have an absolute position in space and time. But in quantum theory the location of objects is fuzzy. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/05/02/making-waves/&#34;&gt;wavelike nature&lt;/a&gt; of quantum objects means they can&amp;rsquo;t be pinned down to a specific location. This means that quantum objects can&amp;rsquo;t be trapped forever within a black hole. There is always a small chance that &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/08/28/great-escape/&#34;&gt;they could escape&lt;/a&gt;, taking a bit of the black hole&amp;rsquo;s mass with it. This escaped radiation came to be known as Hawking radiation. Through Hawking radiation black holes not only had a temperature, but their temperature increased as they radiated away. Thus black holes are not immortal. Like everything else in the universe, they exist for a finite time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the beginning and ending of things is rooted in the nature of time. While it seems obvious that time flows from past to present to future, in physics things aren&amp;rsquo;t so clear. The mathematical equations we use are time symmetric, meaning they work just as well going from past to future as they do going from future to past. It seems that there is nothing inherent to the laws of physics that requires a direction to time. This is known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2015/06/12/times-arrow/&#34;&gt;arrow of time problem&lt;/a&gt;. Why do we experience a direction in time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer seems to lie within thermodynamics. One of the fundamental rules of thermodynamics is that heat flows from warmer objects to colder objects. This is related to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/03/31/dying-light/&#34;&gt;amount of entropy&lt;/a&gt; a system has. Entropy increases over time, and this seems to give a direction to time. In studying this problem Hawking found entropy could account for the arrow of time, but it could also have strange effects. If an expanding universe experiences an arrow of time that moves from past to future, a contracting universe could have an arrow of time that points from future to past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Stephen Hawking explored some of the most challenging and subtle questions in physics and cosmology. He focused on ideas and their implications, not experiments. As a result, none of his ideas have been proven experimentally. Some of his ideas such as Hawking radiation are widely thought to be correct, but that is far from being proven. The legacy Hawking leaves us is in many ways a challenge. Prove that his ideas are correct, or find better answers to the questions he raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in that way the story of Stephen Hawking is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <figcaption><p>Of all the planets, Mercury is the one most affected by relativity.</p></figcaption>
    </figure>&lt;p&gt;One aspect of general relativity that always amazes me is the level of precision needed to distinguish it from Newtonian gravity. Take, for example, the advance of Mercury’s perihelion. When you count in the gravitational tugs from the sun and all the planets, Newton predicts Mercury’s perihelion will advance about 531.65 arcseconds per century. When we measure the orbit of Mercury, we find its perihelion &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; advances 574.10 arcseconds per century. This means Newton’s prediction is off by about 42.45 arcseconds per century. I say “about” because there is an uncertainty in our observations of about 0.65. General relativity predicts an “extra” perihelion advance of 42.98, which agrees exactly with experimental observation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The difference between Newton’s model and Einstein’s amounts to 28 millionths of a degree each orbital revolution. Put another way, Mercury makes one orbit every 87.969 days, but it reaches its perihelion about a half second later than Newton says it should. The difference between Newton and Einstein is less than a human heartbeat in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing about all this? This deviation from Newton was first accurately measured by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859.&lt;/p&gt;
