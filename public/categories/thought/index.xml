      <title>Speaker for the Dead</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most profound question we can hope to answer is whether we are alone in the universe. The vast cosmos is scattered with countless solar systems, and many of these have at least the potential for life. It is quite possible that the universe is teeming with a wondrous variety of exotic life and alien civilizations. It is also possible that life is so rare that Earth alone is life&amp;rsquo;s home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are the odds one way or the other? In 1961 Frank Drake proposed an equation to find out. Drake intended it as a way to frame discussion on the topic, but it came to be known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/03/15/forever-alone/&#34;&gt;Drake Equation&lt;/a&gt;. The equation itself is basically a product of the rate at which stars form in our galaxy, how many stars have planets, how many planets they typically have, what fraction are habitable, what fraction of habitable planets form life, how many form intelligent life, then civilizations, and how long those civilizations last. If you know all of those values, you can calculate the number of civilizations currently living in our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1961 most of the parameters could only be guessed at. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know, for example, whether other stars had planets, since not a single exoplanet had yet been discovered. But we now know that planets are common, and there are somewhere between 8 and 20 billion potentially habitable planets in our galaxy. As a result, there&amp;rsquo;s been renewed interest in searching for signals from alien civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we were to discover such a signal. Suppose a radio telescope starts to detect an unmistakable message from a distant star. &amp;ldquo;Hello! We are where! Message back if you get this!&amp;rdquo; Even the simplest message would revolutionize our understanding of life in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the space between stars is vast, and light takes thousands of years to travel between them. In the time it takes an alien message to reach us, they may have been destroyed by a plague, a meteor impact. In their folly they might destory themselves through war or environmental devastation. The message we receive could be the last cosmic breath of a dead civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently a team &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09399&#34;&gt;looked at this very question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If we discover an alien civilization, what are the odds that they are dead. Like Drake&amp;rsquo;s original equation, their model is rather simple, and intended to foster discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The basic premise is that civilizations survive for a certain period of time, and while they survive they emit signals that could be detected by other civilizations. For example, human civilization has been around for about 12,000 years, but we&amp;rsquo;ve only been able to send radio signals into space for about a century. Those signals travel into space in all directions, so there is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2015/02/19/e-t-phone-home/&#34;&gt;expanding sphere of signals&lt;/a&gt; from Earth about 100 light years in radius. In the unlikely event that our civilization ends this year, our radio signals would continue to spread outward in a spherical shell 100 light years thick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are lots of civilizations in our galaxy, the expanding envelope of their signals would spread throughout the galaxy, eventually overlapping in places. The team then calculated the odds of detecting a signal from a still living civilization vs a dead one. They found that it depends on how long civilizations typically survive. If the age is typically more than 100,000 years, then we are more likely to detect a message from a living civilization. If the lifetime of a civilization is less than that, any message we receive is likely to be from a dead world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have only been sending signals into space for a century. Do you think our civilization will survive for the next 100 centuries. Will humans still exist in the year 102,018? Or will we perish, leaving only the echoes of our once thriving species. Echoes of a species that arose from the dust for a cosmic moment, but while they lived saw only a lonely night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Illusion of Truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Physical theories are often presented as a description of what&amp;rsquo;s really going on. Forces act on a baseball, causing it to fall. Atoms collide and fuse in the heart of a star, releasing heat and energy. Science is true, as is often said, and our scientific theories encapsulate this truth. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely true.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, quantum mechanics is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2013/11/16/taking-the-quantum-leap/&#34;&gt;strange&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes confusing theory. Objects can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/03/07/duality/&#34;&gt;particles and waves&lt;/a&gt;. They do strange things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2013/10/17/the-suns-magic/&#34;&gt;tunnel through barriers&lt;/a&gt;, and can even &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2014/08/28/great-escape/&#34;&gt;appear and disappear&lt;/a&gt;.  Given all this strangeness, what&amp;rsquo;s really going on? What&amp;rsquo;s the true nature of quantum reality? It depends on which approach you want to take. In one view quantum objects are described by a wave-like probability function. When you interact with or &amp;ldquo;observe&amp;rdquo; the object this &amp;ldquo;wavefunction&amp;rdquo; collapses into a definite state. That&amp;rsquo;s view commonly presented, but a quantum system can also be described by its transitions between energy states. Since this uses a mathematical method involving matrices, it&amp;rsquo;s known as matrix mechanics. Both wavefunctions and matrix mechanics give the same results, but their view of what really goes on is very different. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://briankoberlein.com/2015/02/27/dance-of-the-hag/&#34;&gt;path integral method&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than a wavefunction or matrix transitions, path integrals imagine quantum objects can take almost any path between two states. By summing all the possible paths you can derive the odds that it will occur.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/image/heliumlev.gif&#34; alt=&#34;The matrix transition version of quantum theory doesn&amp;#39;t care about the wavefunction.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        The matrix transition version of quantum theory doesn&amp;#39;t care about the wavefunction.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So which one is true? Are quantum objects distributed waves of probability? Are they simply transitions between energy states? Do they take an infinite number of paths between states? Each of these models make the same predictions, so one version is no more &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; than the others. What happens in practice is that we&amp;rsquo;ll use whatever method is useful at the time. They are equivalent models, so the best model for the job is the one we&amp;rsquo;ll use. The only reason the wavefunction view is so common is that it&amp;rsquo;s the version usually taught to introductory students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think this uncertainty of truth is due to the behavior of quantum physics itself. It&amp;rsquo;s so strange and counterintuitive that we can&amp;rsquo;t wrap our puny brains around what&amp;rsquo;s really going on. But the same thing occurs in lots of other fields. Even something as straight forward as basic Newtonian physics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/image/pathintegrals.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;In the path integral view many potential paths are summed.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        In the path integral view many potential paths are summed.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Toss a baseball in the air and Earth&amp;rsquo;s gravitational force pulls it down. The force of gravity is a simple truth, right? While we often describe classical motion in terms of forces and acceleration, we can also describe it in terms of energy and momentum. In the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approach, the path of a baseball is the optimized path among possibilities. In this view a baseball&amp;rsquo;s path is the extrema of an energy equation, and force can be derived as a necessary consequence of this. In the relativistic view the baseball follows a geodesic, which is the minimal path through space and time. So is a baseball&amp;rsquo;s motion due to a gravitational force, an energy extrema, or a spacetime geodesic? As with quantum theory, different approaches yield the same result. They are mathematically equivalent, so we can use whatever method is most useful at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, science is less about truth and more about models. The metaphysics underlying a model is useful only as far as it allows us to make better predictions, generate new ideas, or bring models together as a cohesive whole. This is why we have no problem using classical gravity to calculate the path of a spacecraft through the solar system, while using special relativity to account for the Doppler shift of the spacecraft&amp;rsquo;s radio signals. It&amp;rsquo;s why we can use quantum physics to study atoms in the morning, and general relativity to study black holes in the afternoon. In regimes where models conflict with each other it isn&amp;rsquo;t a failure of truth, but instead shows an opportunity to develop a better model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be that with each better model we move closer to the truth about reality. The truth is out there, and science strives to move towards that truth. It&amp;rsquo;s a common view, and certainly the search for truth has driven many scientists to develop better and better models. But the real power of science is the recognition that what we have are models. Our models can be powerful, but they are always a bit tentative. There&amp;rsquo;s always a chance that they might just be an illusion of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
